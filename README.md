<p>In the chart, we can see that the company makes more profit by selling the skincare products. </p>
<p> As we can see there are 3 categories that the company are selling, let's see how many products are sold in each of the category. </p>
<h3> 3. How many Products are sold in each of these categories? </h3>

<br>
<p> Let's have a view as a pie-chart. </p>

<p>45 % of the sold products belong to the skincare category, while 29.5 % belong to the haircare and 25.5 % belong to the cosmetics product. This chart clearly shows the indication of why skincare category is the most profitable one. </p>
